## 2. Problem Statement

### Chosen Problem: Fintech & Financial Inclusion

**Problem Analysis:**
In rural India, women artisans possess exceptional traditional crafting skills but face significant barriers:
- **Limited Market Access:** Confined to local markets with low pricing
- **Digital Divide:** Lack of technical knowledge and online presence
- **Financial Exclusion:** Dependency on middlemen who take 50-60% margins
- **Skill Stagnation:** No access to modern techniques or learning resources
- **Cultural Preservation Crisis:** Traditional arts are dying due to lack of economic viability

**Real-World Context:**
India has over 200 million artisans, with 70% being women in rural areas. Despite government initiatives like PM MUDRA and Stand-Up India, most women artisans earn less than ₹5,000/month due to limited market reach and exploitation by intermediaries.

**Target Audience:**
- **Primary:** Rural women artisans and craftspeople (pottery, textiles, jewelry, handicrafts)
- **Secondary:** Urban customers seeking authentic handmade products
- **Tertiary:** Craft educators, workshop organizers, and cultural preservation enthusiasts
